Readme for DataAnalysis for energy conservation
-------------------------------------------------
In the following Readme file i will guide you through the instruction of operating this program on your computer in order to use it you need to have following requirements:
1)Anaconda installed(it consists of IDE to use it supports python and uses machine 	             learning package scikit-learn)
2)Dataset must be installed in your table and url must be mentioned with double
  backslashes

Output
-------
The result of program will be deciding which model is better to predict energy consumption which is less and accurate so we can conserve energy and visualize values
